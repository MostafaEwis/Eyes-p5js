# Eyes-p5js
A sketch I made with p5js, it's supposed to be an eye following looking at the cursor. It has two modes:
  - The first mode is "wear glasses" mode, which is supposed to simulate a head that is looking at the cursor.
  - The second mode is the glasses off that makes the eye stay still and the pupil only follow the cursor.
  
  Modes can be changed by clicking the checkbox in the sketch.
